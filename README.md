# GreaseWebpage
Test webpage for MRG labs
To run this project you need to have a server such as the tomcat Apache which can be downloaded here http://tomcat.apache.org/. Additionally, this is run on a MYSQL server/database to make the webpage persistent. This was designed as a test for the MRG Grease Monkey to test its data upload via HTTP GET request.
